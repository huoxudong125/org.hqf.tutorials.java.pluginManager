## Core Application:

The core application acts as the central hub for managing hotel data and providing an interface for users to search and book rooms. It handles core functionalities like:

**Data Storage** : Stores and manages hotel data, including room types, descriptions, prices, and availability.
**Search and Filtering**: Provides a user interface for searching and filtering hotels based on various criteria, such as location, price, amenities, and room types.
**Booking and Payments**: Processes booking requests, handles payments, and manages reservations.
Plugins for Third-Party Data Collection:

Plugins can be developed to connect to different third-party hotel booking platforms or APIs and extract relevant room data. Each plugin can handle a specific third-party provider:

Plugin for Provider A: Connects to Provider A's API, retrieves room data, and parses it into a structured format.
Plugin for Provider B: Connects to Provider B's API, retrieves room data, and parses it into a structured format.
Data Transformation Plugin:

A dedicated plugin can be responsible for transforming the collected third-party room data into your own room type structure:

**Data Mapping**: Maps third-party room attributes to your own room type attributes, ensuring consistency and compatibility.
**Data Enrichment**: Enriches the data with additional information from your own sources or internal data, such as room descriptions, images, or amenities.
**Data Validation**: Validates the transformed data to ensure its accuracy and completeness.
Integration and Presentation:

The core application integrates the data transformation plugin and the third-party data collection plugins to present a unified view of hotel rooms:

Data Integration: Merges the transformed room data from the data transformation plugin with the original third-party data.
Presentation Layer: Presents the combined hotel data to users through the search and filtering UI, ensuring a seamless user experience.
Benefits of Using the Core+Plugin Architecture:

Modular and Extensible: Allows easy addition of new third-party providers without modifying the core application code.

Data Isolation: Isolates data transformation logic from the core application, making it easier to maintain and update.

Reusable Plugins: Plugins can be reused across different applications or projects that require similar data collection and transformation tasks.

Testability: Plugins can be tested independently, improving overall code quality and maintainability.

Additional Considerations:

Data Standardization: Establish a standardized data format for both third-party data and your own room types to facilitate seamless integration.

Data Quality and Consistency: Implement data quality checks and validation mechanisms to ensure the accuracy and consistency of the presented hotel data.

Error Handling and Recovery: Implement robust error handling and recovery mechanisms to handle potential issues with third-party APIs or data transformation.

By effectively utilizing the Core+Plugin architecture, you can create a scalable and maintainable solution for collecting, transforming, and presenting third-party hotel room data, enhancing your application's data coverage and providing a comprehensive hotel booking experience for your users.
